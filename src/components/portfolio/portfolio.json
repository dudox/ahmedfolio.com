We also created a prompt option where users can then choose if they would like to follow up their reports with an image, if they choose to ?! an SMS is then sent to their phone number containing a one-time link where they could take a picture or pictures of the bad road thus completing their report. The agent on the other hand could view reports, users who reported bad roads with analytical data depiction that coordinate better decision making to improve response time to these issues. </p>"

I was glad to be ending that year with loved ones around and what better celebration to end the year than the union of two people bringing everyone together. I got a call from someone I had worked with on a different project months ago asking if I'd be interested in working on a different project relating to matter of religious importance come January of the next year, A church app he said, as a muslim; I was very much interested to work with someone who preached a different faith from what I practiced. Although people often Nigeria is it odds in religious practices, that's farther from the truth; We had discussed briefly over the phone about the paradigm of the project and a possible timeframe to hitting every milestone.

A follow up call about the later discussion, the church app came in on the 5th of January 2021; this time, technically driven and astute to requirements and deliverables. Documents exhanged, the concept, A platform to replace using facebook and youTube as a primary tool for live streaming. Since Flutter was to be used, I dived into action, research on live streaming tools, performance data amongst viable choices, reliabilty and community where the main 3 factors I considered. Reasons,   </p><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Live streaming requires a library with a compression algorithm that's lossless, thus increasing the buffered frame interchange and retain quality of the video. if the goal was to have a very similar experience in comparison to using YouTube and Facebook, two tech giant with limitless resources, I had to go with a reasonable performance metrics.</p><p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Using third party API can be a blessing and a blessing and a curse as most open source libraries are legacy libraries and some are forever changing, meaning, modules become depreciated or improved and at times become quite unstable. This is one big developer's dilemma, as it increases the urgency to always check for broken or obsolete code functions. since this isn't an unforseen issue, looking for libraries with stability and a smart means of notifying developers when changes are implemented in their libabries is something to look out for. </p> <p><strong>Comminity:</strong> &quot;Alone we can do so little; together, we can do so much&quot; â€“ Helen Keller; A developer is only as strong as the community they belong to, that's the power of open source because a lot of libraries are developed by incredible developers around the world in the hope of whatever block of code contributed helps out another. When selecting a library, it's important to know how big of a comminity is associated to that library as it becomes easier to debug issues attributed to that library. </p>"

The Digital Marketting Tool PayWithSellfast was a way to keep tabs on which user had an active running campaign, the traffic growth and analytics to show the income insight real time and within a spaced out period of time. A payment gateway by flutterwave was used for transactional activities within sellfast and the user, then aftwards their informations including their social media handles are capture and their subscription starts; At this point, both parties are alerted via SMS and their campaigns becomes live were could see and interact with their target audience, this also made it easier for the sales team to effectively know when the subscription ends and they're alerted as the processes are automated.  </p>"

In this app, a student can self register or be invited by their designated teacher to onboard the app, afterwards, they are assigned to a specific learning class which could include subjects like, quantitative, verbal reasoning, english, maths etc... Once this is done, they can now unlock weekly assesments set by their designated teachers. \n This is an instant learning application, which means once they answer the questions. Their total score is shown to them for the week and this gets populated to the assesments records for further academic cummulation.",

When I had finally gotten a gig request from an NGO in the United Kingdom, the search I presume was for the contract role for a Fullstack Developer, one would argue that the word 'Fullstack' seem benial and far from reality but I thought to myself. If I am to pull this off, I might as well be qualified to refer to myself as one. After meeting with the clients, or potential client as one might prefer; since at that point, I hadn't been officially hired for the position. they eventually disclosed the project concept and won't you guess what it was?! Yes, you guessed right. A <strong>School Management System</strong>, I was more than interested, the experience for me was all that mattered, another dragon to slay and I was also akeen to the project requirements because like what we already established in my biography, I like to give 110%</p>"

Although, I am very aware that sometimes, clients aren't always technically savvy thus might end up shooting themselves in the legs, whilst some might know exactly what they want ?! I always offer technical consultation about their products thus giving them a clear path to visualizing what the deliverables are. In this particular project. They wanted something quite different from the generic School Management System. Since it was an NGO, their objectives for this project was to partner with schools in giving out free digital tabs to students where Kidaccess would be pre-installed. Then onboard techers under their already partnered instituion. In this whole paradigm, with an urgency to understand the models, relationships and responsibility these actors had indifferent to one another, I made alot of research and created use cases. The product concept was more like a business to business solution, even though it didn't seem so at first ?! Meeting up to every deliverables projected a much more opportuinistic product with countless problem solving realm to explore.  </p>"

It's common for there to be changes in client's objective during the development phase, one could even argue that every software engineer anticipate this especially when you're a freelancer thus working with someone at an idea stage. Yes, I did anticipate shifting dynamics but it became quite a difficulty for me when it became too frequent. Newer upgrades outside the agreed deliverables became so much. Like I said, the product was quite broad that it opened room for a lot of opportuinities and exploits, my client wanted to explore all these exploits during the development which eventually delayed the agreed upon deadline for the product. </p>"
